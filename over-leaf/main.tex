\section{Introduction}

The rise of remote work and digital collaboration has transformed online meetings into a vital communication tool for businesses and organizations worldwide. Platforms like Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams facilitate essential discussions, decision-making, and task assignments. However, the increased frequency of meetings can lead to information overload, making it difficult for participants to recall key points and outcomes. This challenge is compounded by the absence of a streamlined, automated system for capturing and summarizing these discussions, which often leaves professionals overwhelmed and unable to quickly access actionable insights.

Effective meeting documentation is critical, as it enables participants to review important decisions, responsibilities, and action items post-meeting. Traditionally, note-taking has been used to address this need, but manual methods are inconsistent and prone to human error. The inefficiency of reviewing lengthy meeting recordings or transcriptions adds to the challenge, especially when swift decision-making is required. This project addresses these issues by introducing an automated summarization system, designed to generate concise and coherent executive summaries of online meetings.

Our solution uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to capture audio content from meetings, transcribe it into text, and process it using both extractive and abstractive summarization methods. Extractive methods, such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and TextRank, identify the most relevant content by ranking important words and sentences. Simultaneously, abstractive methods like transformer models (e.g., BERT) create more natural and coherent summaries by generating new sentences that capture the essence of the meeting, even when key points are scattered across different sections of the conversation.

To further refine the summarization process, the system integrates Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. These techniques allow the model to identify and highlight specific entities such as names, dates, and actions, enhancing the relevance and clarity of the summaries. By identifying crucial details like decisions made and responsibilities assigned, the system produces summaries that are both informative and actionable, improving the overall quality and usability of meeting documentation.

Evaluating the performance of this system is essential to ensure its practicality in real-world applications. ROUGE scores, which measure the precision, recall, and accuracy of generated summaries against reference summaries, will be used as a primary evaluation metric. Additionally, stakeholder feedback from potential users will provide qualitative insights into the system's effectiveness, allowing for iterative improvements based on real-world needs and preferences.

In conclusion, our automated summarization system offers a powerful tool to enhance meeting efficiency by ensuring that vital information is easily accessible and accurately documented. By alleviating the burden of manual note-taking and facilitating quick access to meeting highlights, this project aims to streamline communication workflows, supporting better decision-making and increased productivity in today’s dynamic work environments.

\section{Methodology}

In this research, we present a comprehensive system for generating executive summaries from online meeting transcripts, utilizing both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques combined with Named Entity Recognition (NER) and action item detection. The methodology aims to overcome the unique challenges posed by spoken language in meetings, which often includes filler words, redundant phrases, and multiple speakers. The architecture of our system integrates advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to ensure that summaries are not only concise and coherent but also highly relevant and actionable. By synthesizing techniques from previous research, including TF-IDF, TextRank, BERT, and transformer models like BART and T5, our approach is capable of handling transcripts in diverse formats from popular platforms such as Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom.

The initial phase involves \textbf{Audio-to-Text Conversion}, where meeting audio or video recordings are transcribed into text. This conversion is essential, as it transforms the spoken language into a structured textual format suitable for NLP processing. Given the variability in audio quality and speaker accents in online meetings, we use Whisper AI, a state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model that demonstrates robust performance across various dialects and noise conditions. Whisper AI utilizes a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, trained on extensive datasets to deliver high transcription accuracy. The audio processing pipeline leverages the `moviepy` and `pydub` libraries for extracting audio from video, segmenting it if needed, and subsequently passing it to the ASR model for transcription.

Once transcribed, the \textbf{Data Preprocessing} phase commences, which is critical to improve the text’s readability and eliminate unnecessary noise. Spoken language often contains hesitations, filler words, and conversational redundancies that need to be removed for cleaner summaries. Using libraries like NLTK and spaCy, the preprocessing step involves tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization. Tokenization segments the text into manageable units, facilitating efficient information extraction. Stop-word removal then eliminates non-informative words, while lemmatization ensures words are standardized to their base forms, reducing complexity. This preprocessing stage not only streamlines the data but also enhances the accuracy of downstream NLP models by focusing their attention on core meeting content.

For \textbf{Extractive Summarization}, the system employs Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and TextRank algorithms to identify and rank sentences that are central to the meeting content. TF-IDF is a statistical measure that assesses word importance by examining word frequency within a document relative to its frequency across multiple documents, making it ideal for detecting salient terms that signify main topics. TextRank, on the other hand, is a graph-based algorithm that ranks sentences by evaluating their similarity and interconnectivity. Each sentence is represented as a node, and edges represent semantic similarity, allowing TextRank to capture the relationships among sentences. By combining these techniques, we generate a concise extractive summary that highlights the key points discussed in the meeting.

Beyond extraction, we utilize \textbf{Abstractive Summarization} to rephrase and reorganize content into more natural language. Abstractive techniques are critical in producing summaries that are not only informative but also readable, especially when information is dispersed across various segments of a meeting. For this, we employ transformer-based models like BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) and T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer). BART operates by corrupting the input text and training the model to reconstruct it, effectively learning complex dependencies within the text. T5, designed under a text-to-text framework, can transform long, verbose transcripts into succinct summaries. Both models are fine-tuned on large, publicly available datasets to improve their generalization capabilities, ensuring applicability across varied meeting topics and structures.

In order to enhance contextual relevance, \textbf{Named Entity Recognition (NER)} is incorporated to identify specific names, dates, organizations, and roles within the transcripts. NER allows the model to attribute specific actions or discussions to particular entities, thereby personalizing the summary to reflect the contributions and responsibilities of different participants. By integrating NER, the summary highlights not only what was discussed but also who was involved, improving traceability of decisions. We use BERT-based models fine-tuned on entity recognition tasks, which leverage contextual embeddings to accurately detect entities, even in informal and complex spoken language found in meeting transcripts.

A key feature of our system is \textbf{Action Item Extraction}, which isolates statements that specify tasks or assignments, aiding in follow-up and accountability. This feature is implemented using a BERT-based classifier trained to detect action-oriented statements, leveraging binary classification to distinguish between general discussions and actionable items. Action items are essential in meetings as they designate tasks, responsibilities, and deadlines. By automating their detection, we enhance the practical utility of the summary, transforming it into a tool for tracking responsibilities and supporting efficient task management. The classifier is fine-tuned on a labeled dataset, ensuring high precision in recognizing actionable content amidst general discussions.

Given the length and complexity of many meeting transcripts, the system incorporates a \textbf{Summarization Pipeline with Chunking} to process extensive transcripts more effectively. This approach, inspired by methodologies in multi-stage pipeline summarization, divides the transcript into smaller, thematic segments before summarizing each individually. Chunking addresses challenges related to memory constraints and information overload by ensuring that each segment is summarized with high relevance. After summarizing each chunk, the resulting summaries are integrated into a coherent, single summary. This method also aligns with the design of BART and T5, which tend to perform better with shorter text inputs, thereby optimizing their summarization efficacy for long-form content.

The generated summaries are evaluated through \textbf{ROUGE Scoring and Human Evaluation}. ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a set of metrics that measure the overlap between generated summaries and reference summaries in terms of precision, recall, and F1 scores. Specifically, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L are used to evaluate unigram, bigram, and longest common subsequence matches, respectively. High ROUGE scores indicate that the summary retains a significant amount of relevant information from the original transcript. Complementing ROUGE, human evaluation involves subject matter experts who assess readability, coherence, and the summary’s alignment with meeting objectives. Feedback from users is integrated into model retraining and fine-tuning, further refining the system’s performance.

For \textbf{Computational Optimization and Deployment}, model efficiency is critical to accommodate diverse user environments, particularly those with limited computational resources. We employ model compression techniques such as pruning and quantization on transformer models like BART and T5. Pruning involves removing non-essential model parameters, while quantization reduces the precision of model weights, both of which significantly reduce the memory footprint and processing time without sacrificing much accuracy. The system is deployed using cloud services, making it accessible to users without the need for high-end hardware. APIs are also created for integration with meeting platforms, providing seamless usability for professionals in various sectors.

The \textbf{Application Scenarios and Flexibility} of the system are diverse. Beyond corporate meetings, it can be used in educational webinars, virtual conferences, and even health consultations, offering robust support across domains. For example, educational institutions can use it to summarize online lectures, while healthcare organizations may employ it to document telehealth consultations. The system’s flexibility lies in its modular design, which allows users to customize features according to their needs—extracting summaries with or without action items, or generating audio summaries for accessibility.

Our methodology, therefore, synthesizes techniques from leading research in NLP-based summarization, structured to create a highly adaptable and accurate summarization tool tailored for modern online meeting environments. This approach not only provides a solution for summarizing digital meetings but also advances NLP applications in dynamic, real-world settings where information retention and task follow-up are critical. Through its modular architecture, robust NLP techniques, and efficient deployment strategy, this system contributes meaningfully to the field of automated meeting summarization, supporting professionals in managing information-rich virtual interactions.

\section{Conclusion}

The automated summarization system developed in this research represents a significant step forward in addressing the challenges of information retention and task management within online meeting environments. By synthesizing extractive and abstractive summarization techniques, our approach effectively distills key points and critical decisions from lengthy transcripts, providing concise yet comprehensive summaries. Leveraging both traditional NLP techniques, such as TF-IDF and TextRank, and state-of-the-art transformer models like BART and T5, the system ensures that essential information is highlighted while maintaining fluency and coherence. Additionally, the integration of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and action item extraction elevates the practical utility of these summaries, allowing users to track responsibilities, deadlines, and other actionable elements directly from the output. This combination of features not only enhances the relevance and readability of meeting summaries but also addresses the specific needs of modern remote and hybrid workplaces, where rapid access to information can significantly impact productivity and decision-making.

Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the model achieves strong performance, with high ROUGE scores reflecting its ability to retain critical information while compressing complex discussions into concise summaries. Human evaluations further validate the system’s effectiveness, as users consistently report that the summaries capture the key points of discussions accurately and coherently. Moreover, the use of a chunk-based pipeline in the summarization process enables the model to manage extensive meeting transcripts effectively, segmenting content by themes or topics before generating focused summaries for each segment. This approach not only ensures that long and multi-topic meetings are handled smoothly but also aligns with the architecture of transformer models, which benefit from chunked inputs for processing efficiency and contextual relevance.

Adapting the system to accommodate a broader array of industry-specific lexicons and expanding its support for multilingual summarization would enhance its accessibility for global and diverse user bases. Furthermore, the potential for real-time summarization, where summaries are generated during live meetings, represents an exciting frontier that could transform how meeting information is managed and utilized in fast-paced environments. As NLP and AI continue to evolve, the integration of more sophisticated contextual understanding and cross-linguistic capabilities could further enhance the system’s effectiveness and applicability.
